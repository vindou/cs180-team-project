Description:
    For phase 1 of this project, we were tasked with creating the database side of our project, which 
    is to code a social media application. We chose to create a Direct Messaging social media application,
    and so our main storage is in the storing of Users and Messages.

Ideas and Implementation:
    Because we chose to implement Messaging, we came up with a basic outline of having User and Message classes, 
    as well as Databases for each of those. This is how the User, UserDatabase, Message, and the supporting Conversation,
    FileMessage, TextMessages, and Conversation Database classes were created.
